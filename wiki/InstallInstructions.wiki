Installing RSSDler is pretty easy, though its ease depends on what platform you are on. First, covering the pre-requisites:

  # Python (required):
    * If you are using Linux, you likely have python available in your distributions repository. This should be as easy as "apt-get install python" or "yum install python" or similar.
    * Otherwise, visit the [http://www.python.org/download/ python download page], and download the installer appropriate for your system. Open it and follow the on-screen instructions.
    * Optional: Many people find [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall EasyInstall] the easiest way to install 3rd party modules. I have not tested EasyInstall, but it should work well. [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#installing-easy-install Installation Instructions].
    * Further instructions can be found at python.org as well as [http://diveintopython.org/installing_python/index.html diveintopython].
  # Feedparser (required):
    * Again, on Linux, this is probably in your distributions repository: "apt-get install python-feedparser" or similar will probably Just Work (tm).
    * "easyinstall feedparser" on the command line
    * Otherwise, go to the [http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/downloads/list feedparser download page], 
      * unpack the file to C:\feedparser, or similar, 
      * go to the command line (windows: start, run, cmd <enter>)
      * cd to the directory you unpacked feedparser to (e.g. "cd C:\feedparser")
      * run python on the setup.py file with the install option: "C:\Python25\python.exe setup install" or similar
  # Mechanize (recommended, but not required):
    * Again, on linux, this is probably as easy as "apt-get install python-mechanize" or similar.
    * "easyinstall mechanize" on the command line
    * Otherwise, follow the similar procedure for feedparser for [http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/#source mechanize]
  # BitTorrent (not required, will not be used at all when 0.3.5 comes out (r64 and later)):
    * Linux: "apt-get install bittorrent"
    * Please report how to get this working on Windows/OSX, the procedure may be substantially different.

Now that that is done, make a directory to keep all your rssdler related files (not necessarily your downloads) in. [http://code.google.com/p/rssdler/downloads/list Download] either the rssdler.py or the rssdler.tar.gz tarball to that directory, and unpack the tarball if that is what you got. RSSDler should be run from that directory. Future versions may be configured to allow a full system install, though that is not currently available. You have now 'installed' all the requirements for RSSDler as well as RSSDler itself. Take a look at the HelpMessage and CommentedConfig
