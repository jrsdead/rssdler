How to install rTorrent on a Debian-based distro with my packages:

  * If you have previously installed from source/svn, it would be a good idea to make uninstall
  * Download the .debs (assuming you want 0.8.0/0.12.0):
    * wget http://rssdler.googlecode.com/files/rtorrent_0.8.0-0_i386.deb
    * wget http://rssdler.googlecode.com/files/libtorrent10_0.12.0-0_i386.deb
  * Use dpkg to install:
    * sudo dpkg -i libtorrent10_0.12.0-0_i386.deb
    * sudo dpkg -i rtorrent_0.8.0-0_i386.deb
  * Enjoy
