  * A PostDownloadFunction can now do Episode Advancement! (advanceEpisode)
    (see function docstring for details on how to call)
  * added rssdler, to be a 'run script' that will be installed in /usr/bin
    aka Global Install
  * Made -h print only the command line options, added -f/--full-help to print the entire help doc
  * changed default config.txt location to ~/.rssdler/config.txt
  * changed workingDir default to ~/.rssdler (~ expanded by os.path.expanduser)
