    * new log function for easier logging of errors (will begin to add error
        information to downloads.log)
    * open text files as utf-8 for reading/writing/appending
    * convert url to ISO-8859-1 to prevent unicode errors in httplib from
        cropping up (mechRetrievePage)
    * work on proper quoting/encoding of invalid urls (mechRetrievePage)
    * removed call to Config().save. aka stops clobbering the config file. No
        changes to config are made during run time, except for setting
        defaults, so this should be safe. save still exists as a method of
        Config(), if you want to make use of it in a postDownloadFunction.
        Allows for dynamic working directory, unless it is explicitly set in
        the config file. (run)
    * removed missed check for the former 10 minute scan time minimum (run)
    * fixed (I think) the utfWriter/sys.stdout conflict in status()/global
        variables
    * removed the requirement for cookies. If a file is specified (new default
        is None), then it will fail if it can't find a properly Netscape
        formatted cookie file. If None is specified, it will exclude the cookie
        jar from the url opener (mechRetrievePage)
    * set the shabang to /usr/bin/env python
    * reworked filename guessing from url. Now parses the url, takes the path,
        splits off the last element after /, and unquotes that. Still tries to
        grab from HTTP headers first. (getFilenameFromHTTP). If you know of a
        standarized method for getting the filename from the url, please send
        it to me.
