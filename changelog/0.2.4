    * moved kill action outside optparse loop so that config file location can
        be more reliably recognized
    * improved exception handling, notifcation, and logging of errors.
        Hopefully this will allow users to more easily identify problems they
        are having and to fix their setup or report bugs as necessary.
    * removed dependency on mechanize, though that dependency is still default.
        To get rid of it, set urllib = True in global options to make use of
        urllib2. (new Function: urllib2RetrievePage)
    * added error option to global. 0=Suppress all error messages. 1=Print
        error to stderr. 2=Log error to logfile. 3=2+1 aka log and stderr. . .
        Default is 1(status)
    * reduced mechRetrievePage to only fetch urls to reduce complexity of
        function.
    * removed support for 'rss' and 'checkTime' options. Check out the
        analogous updated options (rssFeed and related, checkTimeDay and
        related)
    * removed eval statements
    * regExTrueOptions/regExFalseOptions now apply to download<x> and
        download<x>False if set.
    * added -f/--failed to clear failed downloads from the queue so that you
        can clear them out if they are repeatedly trying to download and not
        working and you just don't care anymore.
    * attempt at improving filename/filetype guessing (getFilenameFromHTTP)
    * try to determine terminal width, adjust text output for more readable
        messages
